    <h4>Team Members Can Be Anywhere</h4>
    <img src="../assets/images/banner.jpg">
    <p>
     As long as they have an Internet connection, team members can be working remotely from anywhere in the world. This means that it’s possible for a team to be completely dispersed, while still working in an organized way. Co-workers in different states or even countries can easily work together on the same project, helping organizations put together the best possible team for a project, regardless of the location of the employees. It also means that while employees are away from the office on a business trip, they don’t need to be disconnected from the project, and can contribute to it as if they were on their desks.

    <h4>It’s Easy to Keep Track of Projects</h4>
    <img src="../assets/images/banner.jpg">
    <p>
    Online collaboration tools have a variety of project tracking capabilities that make it easy for team members to see the evolution of a project from day one. From tracking who made the latest changes to a document, to how the document was before the changes, to tagging a colleague to review the document, it’s never been easier to manage a project. Online collaboration tools remove the need to use e-mail as the primary means of communicating with team members, so the need to search an inbox for a lost document, for example, is completely removed.
